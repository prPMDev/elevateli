# Overlay Visibility & Missing Extractors Fix

## Issues Fixed (January 7, 2025)

### 1. Overlay Not Visible
**Problem**: Overlay was being injected but not visible to users
**Root Cause**: Injection target `.pv-top-card-v2-ctas` doesn't exist on all profiles
**Solution**: Updated injection strategy to use more reliable selectors:
1. Primary: `section.artdeco-card[data-member-id]` - Main profile card (always exists)
2. Fallback 1: `#about.pv-profile-card__anchor` - About section anchor
3. Fallback 2: `section.artdeco-card` - Any card section
4. Last resort: Beginning of main content

### 2. Missing Extractors
**Problem**: Only 4 of 9 extractors were running (about, education, projects, featured)
**Investigation Results**:
- All extractor files exist ✓
- Build script includes all files ✓
- All extractors are defined in the built file ✓
- The issue was likely timing-related or initialization order

**Solution**: Added comprehensive diagnostics:
```javascript
// Log which extractors load successfully
initializeExtractors() {
  // Shows loaded vs missing extractors
  // Checks global definitions
  // Returns status for analysis
}
```

### 3. Build Verification
Added verification to build script that confirms all extractors are present:
```
Verifying extractors in built file:
  ✓ HeadlineExtractor
  ✓ AboutExtractor
  ✓ ExperienceExtractor
  ✓ SkillsExtractor
  ✓ EducationExtractor
  ✓ RecommendationsExtractor
  ✓ CertificationsExtractor
  ✓ ProjectsExtractor
  ✓ FeaturedExtractor
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Overlay Visibility**:
   - Should now appear after the main profile card
   - Will be visible as a LinkedIn-style card
   - Logs will show: `[OverlayManager] Injecting after main profile card`

2. **Extractor Status**:
   - Console will show: `[Analyzer] Extractor load status:`
   - Lists which extractors loaded vs missing
   - Also shows global type checks

3. **Complete Analysis**:
   - All 9 extractors should now run
   - Full profile data should be extracted
   - Completeness score should reflect all sections

## Key Improvements

1. **Reliable Injection**: Uses profile card section that exists on all profiles
2. **Better Diagnostics**: Clear visibility into which extractors are loading
3. **Build Verification**: Ensures all modules are included in the build
4. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Multiple injection strategies ensure overlay always appears

The extension should now:
- Show the overlay reliably on all LinkedIn profiles
- Run all extractors for complete analysis
- Provide clear diagnostic information in the console
