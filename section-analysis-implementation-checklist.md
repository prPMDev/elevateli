## File Locations
- Main extraction: `extension/content/analyzer.js`
- Service worker: `extension/background/service-worker.js`
- Dashboard UI: `extension/options/options.html`
- Dashboard JS: `extension/options/options.js`
- Implementation guide: `profile-score-calculator-implementation.js`

## Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Bundled extractors** - Chrome Manifest V3 blocks dynamic imports
2. **Weighted scoring** - 30% About, 30% Experience, 20% Skills, 10% Headline, 5% Others
3. **Score capping** - Missing About caps at 7/10, missing Experience at 6/10
4. **Progressive analysis** - Quick overall first, then section-by-section on demand
