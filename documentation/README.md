## Scoring System

### Quality Score Calculation
The extension uses a sophisticated weighted scoring system that ensures profiles have substantial content:

**Section Weights:**
- About Section: 30%
- Experience: 30% 
- Skills: 20%
- Headline: 10%
- Education: 5%
- Recommendations: 5%

**Critical Section Caps:**
Missing critical sections limits your maximum possible score:
- No About section â†’ Max score: 7/10
- No Experience â†’ Max score: 6/10
- No Skills â†’ Max score: 9/10
- No Recommendations â†’ Max score: 8/10

**Example:** A profile with excellent Headline (9/10) and Skills (8/10) but missing About and Experience sections would score only 6/10 (not 8.3/10) due to the Experience cap.

## Cache-First Strategy
The extension uses an intelligent cache-first approach to minimize costs and improve performance:

**How it works:**
1. **Cache Check First**: Before extracting any data, checks if valid cached analysis exists
2. **Skip Extraction**: If cache is valid (within duration), only runs quick completeness check
3. **Smart Refresh**: Full extraction only happens when cache expires or user forces refresh
4. **Performance Boost**: Pages load 3-5x faster with cached data

**Benefits:**
- Reduces page load time from ~5s to ~1s
- Prevents unnecessary DOM parsing
- Saves API costs on repeat visits
- Shows cached age indicator (e.g., "2 days ago")

## Structured AI Response Format
The extension uses a standardized JSON response format for consistent, parseable AI analysis:

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "overallScore": { "score": 8.5, "grade": "B+", "percentage": 85 },
  "sectionScores": {
    "about": { "exists": true, "score": 9, "weight": 0.30 },
    "experience": { "exists": true, "score": 8, "weight": 0.30 }
  },
  "recommendations": {
    "critical": [
      {
        "section": "about",
        "action": {
          "what": "Add quantified achievements",
          "why": "Increases profile views by 40%",
          "how": "Include 3-5 metrics with % or $ impact"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "insights": {
    "strengths": ["Strong technical skills", "Clear career progression"],
    "gaps": ["Missing quantified results", "Generic headline"]
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent parsing across AI providers
- Structured recommendations with what/why/how
- Detailed section-by-section scoring
- Machine-readable for future features
