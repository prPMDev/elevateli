# ElevateLI - Development Status

## Current Implementation (v0.3.3) ‚úÖ

### Core Functionality
- **Two-Score System**: Visual gauges for Completeness (0-100%) and Content Quality (1-10)
- **Profile Extraction**: Complete extraction with "Show all" clicking for skills/experience
- **LinkedIn Overlay**: Clean single-line display with logo, scores, and actions
- **Dashboard**: Professional UI with visual gauges, card layouts, and unified action bar
- **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, O3) and Anthropic (Claude models)
- **AI Integration**: Temperature 0.1 for consistency, weighted scoring with critical caps
- **Cache System**: 7-day default, shows cached results even when AI disabled
- **Export Options**: PDF and CSV export for analysis reports
- **Batch Analysis**: 30-40% cost savings for multi-section analysis

### Recent Major Features (July 2025)
- **Cache-First AI Strategy**: Reduces costs from $0.05/visit to $0.05/week per profile
- **Cache UI Controls**: Enable/disable toggle, duration slider, statistics, clear cache
- **Progress Overlay**: Shows extraction phases with timing (Discovery ~50ms, Full ~500ms)
- **Sequential Analysis**: AI follows LinkedIn section order (Photo‚ÜíHeadline‚ÜíAbout‚ÜíExperience‚ÜíSkills)
- **Open to Work Integration**: Included in AI analysis for better recommendations
- **Target Role Mapping**: Fixed "pm" ‚Üí "Product Manager" (not "project manager")

### User Experience
- Progress overlay during extraction: "Analyzing profile..." ‚Üí "Completeness calculated..." ‚Üí "Requesting AI analysis..."
- Cache indicators: "Last analyzed by AI (X days ago)" in popup and overlay
- "Run New Analysis" bypasses cache for fresh results
- "View Full Report" opens dashboard for detailed analysis
- Consistent "Quality Score (AI)" naming across UI

### Technical Architecture
- Manifest V3 Chrome extension with modular design
- Service worker with cache layer
- Content script split into 9 core modules + extractors
- Local storage for API keys, settings, and cache
- No external server dependencies
- Extraction timing: ~50ms discovery, ~500ms full extraction
- Build system bundles ES6 modules for MV3 compatibility

## Recent Updates (January 2025) ‚úÖ
- **Professional UI Redesign**: Visual gauges, card layouts, LinkedIn-inspired design
- **Simplified Overlay**: Single-line view with essential information only
- **Complete Data Extraction**: Fixed skills/experience "Show all" clicking
- **Timestamp Fixes**: Proper handling of ISO and numeric timestamps
- **Service Worker**: Fixed URL handling and undefined errors
- **Dashboard Improvements**: Reduced whitespace, better visual hierarchy
- **Profile Essentials**: Combined About, Headline, and Photo analysis

## Recent Updates (January 7, 2025) üÜï
- **Modular Architecture Implementation**: Split 3000+ line analyzer.js into focused modules
- **9 Core Modules**: constants, state, memory, DOM, Chrome utils, discovery, extraction, UI, main
- **10 Specialized Extractors**: About, Experience, Skills, Education, Certifications, etc.
- **Build System**: PowerShell/Bash scripts bundle modules for Manifest V3
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns, easier debugging
- **Memory Management**: Centralized cleanup prevents leaks
- **Type Safety Ready**: Architecture prepared for TypeScript migration

## Recent Updates (July 4, 2025 - Part 3)
- **Enable AI Toggle**: AI off by default, shows "(AI Off)" in badge
- **Section Analysis UI**: Dashboard cards for About/Experience/Skills (~$0.01 each)
- **AboutExtractor**: Bundled into analyzer.js, extracts full text
- **ProfileScoreCalculator**: Architecture complete but NOT INTEGRATED (blocker)

## Recent Fixes (July 4, 2025 - Parts 1&2) ‚úÖ
- **Cache Implementation**: Complete cache-first strategy with UI controls
- **Temperature Fix**: Reduced to 0.1 for more consistent AI responses
- **Target Role Fix**: Proper role name mapping in all prompts
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time feedback during extraction
- **Sequential Analysis**: AI recommendations follow profile section order
- **Open to Work**: Extracted and included in AI analysis
- **UI Consistency**: "Quality Score (AI)" used everywhere
- **Error Handling**: Safe Chrome API wrappers prevent context errors

## Next Steps üöÄ

### 1. Complete Weighted Scoring System (CRITICAL)
- ‚ùå ProfileScoreCalculator implementation in service-worker.js
- ‚ùå Integration with AI response processing
- ‚ùå Score capping for missing critical sections
- Architecture complete in `scoring-architecture.md`

### 2. Complete Section-by-Section Analysis
- ‚úÖ About extractor (bundled into analyzer.js)
- ‚úÖ Experience extractor (implemented) 
- ‚úÖ Skills extractor (with endorsements)
- ‚úÖ Weighted scoring architecture (30% About, 30% Experience, 20% Skills)
- ‚è≥ Individual section AI analysis
- ‚è≥ Custom instructions per section

### 2. Enhanced Features
- Full report view with all findings (not just top 5)
- Photo analysis for non-GPT-4o models
- Resume upload and keyword comparison
- Export analysis results (PDF/CSV)
- Industry benchmarking
- Profile change detection

### 3. Performance & Quality
- Batch API calls for section analysis
- Improved error handling for API failures
- Add unit tests
- Reduce bundle size

## Architecture Notes
- Cache key: profileId + content hash (invalidates on changes)
- Completeness calculated instantly client-side
- AI analysis cached for cost savings
- API keys encrypted in local storage
- Extension only activates on LinkedIn domains
